# Shijian for Watchy

![Shijian screenshot](/screenshot/Shijian.gif?raw=true)

## About
**Shijian** is a simple aesthetic Chinese watchface for [Watchy](https://watchy.sqfmi.com/). It is modified from [Stationary Text](https://github.com/BraininaBowl/Stationary-Text-for-Watchy).

* It only tells the time, so only NTP settings are sufficient for syncing.
* The characters for the hour are in uppercase (大写) to fit with the style.
* Only the files in the `src` folder are required for deployment.
* Unfortunately, the font is only for *Simplified Chinese*, so there will be no *Traditional Chinese* version of this watchface.

## Customisation
Modifying the logic is very simple:
* To switch numbers between uppercase and lowercase, just replace `uc` in the array names with `lc` or vice versa.
* To use light mode, just swap all instances of `GxEPD_WHITE` with `GxEPD_BLACK`.

Modifying the glyphs can be pretty complicated:
* All fonts are in the `font` folder.
* Most uppercase English letters were replaced with Chinese glyphs during the conversion to GFX.
* If you need those uppercase characters back, you'll need to convert the fonts yourself.

To convert the glyphs, [fontconvert](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library/tree/master/fontconvert) was implemented in Python with [freetype-py](https://pypi.org/project/freetype-py/). If there's interest, I'll open-source the script.
